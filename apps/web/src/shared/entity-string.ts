/**
 * Entity String comes from the middleware rather than the OTTK OData service: the middleware
 * reads ZSGTSFTR_ENT_STR directly, so a new entity row is visible without an ABAP transport.
 * Both consoles read the same list, hence one loader here rather than a copy in each.
 *
 * Three differences from the OData service, all handled here:
 *  - the payload is `{ ok, rows }` rather than a `value` collection;
 *  - the columns keep SAP's raw table names and are mapped to the EntityRow the forms speak;
 *  - the table holds every entity, not just the SLC ones, so ZSLC is filtered on. 'X' is
 *    SAP's abap_true marker: the row is flagged for SLC use.
 *
 * Both the filter and the limit are pushed to the middleware, which rejects a parameter it
 * does not recognise rather than ignoring it. The limit is explicit because it pages at 50
 * by default — a silently truncated dropdown reads as missing master data.
