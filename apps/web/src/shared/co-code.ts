 * fills Company Code and its name — so the full row is narrowed to the three fields that
 * drives, and rows with no ZCOM_ID are left in place: a blank applicant returns before the
 * lookup, so they can never match.
 *
 * The limit is explicit for the same reason as the other middleware lookups: it pages by
 * default, and a silently truncated mapping would show as Company Code simply not filling in.
