 * One structure's reports: the folders held under that structure in

 *
 * The four structures are four routes off Reporting and four entries in the sidebar, but
 * they differ only in which top-level node of the tree they show, so they share this one
 * component rather than four near-identical files.
 *
 * The node is found by label, not by position, so reordering reporting-menu.json can never
 * quietly point a page at another structure's reports; a label that is not in the file at
 * all leaves the section empty, which is what MenuBrowser already renders while the fetch
 * is in flight.
